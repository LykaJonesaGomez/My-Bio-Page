    <h1 style="color:red;">PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE</h1>
    <p> style="color:red;">From 2022 to present - Faculty - Grade 6 Adviser. I am proud to be a part of the teaching field, as it been my dream since I was a child. I believe
     in saying "a good teacher can inspire hope, ignite the imagination, and instill a love of learning"
     I believe that being a teacher for three years for me is not easy, there's some instances that I 
     encountered some challenges especially in handling the behavior of my students but I realized that 
     becoming a TEACHER is becoming a student again. We learn from the children in as mush as they learn
     new things from us</p>
